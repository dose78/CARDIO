Make it possible to parallelize get_next_subproblem()

Make it possible to return all of the subproblems at once so we don't have to realloc every time?

Do result allocation dynamically?

Make it possible to pass arbitrary state to the next call to get_next_subproblem (e.g. an array of all of the remaining subproblems, etc...)?
