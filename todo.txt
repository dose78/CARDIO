Make it possible to parallelize get_next_subproblem()
Make it possible to pass arbitrary state to the next call to get_next_subproblem (e.g. an array of all of the remaining subproblems, etc...)?

EXPERIMENTAL
don't need to allocate Q in DFS CARMA
merge should free anything that was alloced in split (i.e. subproblems)
